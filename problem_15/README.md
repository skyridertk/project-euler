## Project Euler: Problem 15: Lattice paths
Starting in the top left corner of a 2Ã—2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.
![Paths](lattice_paths.gif)
a diagram of 6 2 by 2 grids showing all the routes to the bottom right corner

How many such routes are there through a given gridSize?

## Tests
latticePaths(4) should return 70.

latticePaths(9) should return 48620.

latticePaths(20) should return 137846528820.
