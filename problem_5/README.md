## Project Euler: Problem 5: Smallest multiple
`2520` is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from `1` to `10` without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to n?

## Tests
`smallestMult(5)` should return `60`
`smallestMult(7)` should return `420`
`smallestMult(10)` should return `2520`
`smallestMult(13)` should return `360360`
`smallestMult(20)` should return `232792560`
