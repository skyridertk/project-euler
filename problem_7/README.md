## Project Euler: Problem 7: 10001st prime
By listing the first six prime numbers: `2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13`, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the nth prime number?

## Tests
`nthPrime(6)` should return `13`

`nthPrime(10)` should return `29`

`nthPrime(100)` should return `541`

`nthPrime(1000)` should return `7919`

`nthPrime(10001)` should return `104743`
